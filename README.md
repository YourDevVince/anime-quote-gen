# Anime quote generator

One thing about me is that I love anime. My favorite would be One Piece by Eiichiro Oda, which is why it only spews out One Piece quotes... so far haha. 

## Honorable Mentions

https://yurippe.vercel.app/ and https://github.com/4rnv/QuotesAPI for a easy to use API, where I fetch my quotes from. 

Chat GPT for the art background. ( Im not that good at drawing digital art, I wish ) 

## Project features

- Random Anime Quote Generator – Get a new quote from One Piece with the click of a button.
- Error Handling – Displays a friendly fallback quote when the API fails or returns invalid data.
- Responsive UI – Built with React and styled for modern devices using Tailwind CSS.
- REST API Integration – Quotes are fetched live from a public API
- Asynchronous Data Fetching – Uses async/await and the native fetch() API to retrieve and display quotes.
